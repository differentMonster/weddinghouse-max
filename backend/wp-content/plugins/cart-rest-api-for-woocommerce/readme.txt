RESTful API that focuses on the front-end of the store with an integration to build your headless store with ease.

== Description ==

### CoCart: The #1 RESTful API that handles the front-end of WooCommerce.

[CoCart](https://cocart.xyz/?utm_medium=wp.org&utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=cocart) allows you to seamlessly connect your WooCommerce store via our REST API so developers can use the frameworks and tools they know and love to build a headless store with ease.

WooCommerce does not nativley come with cart support via the REST API so if you have been struggerling to build a headless store. CoCart will save you hours of development time. Don't build an API, build the store.

You can read more about the details of Semver at [semver.org](https://semver.org/)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is CoCart free? =

Yes! CoCart’s core features are absolutely free. [CoCart Pro completes the full cart experience!](https://cocart.xyz/pro/?utm_medium=wp.org&utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=cocart)

= How do I start using CoCart? =

You will first need WooCommerce installed with the REST API enabled. Then install CoCart and follow the documentation.

> Please check the requirements listed in the [installation](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cart-rest-api-for-woocommerce/#installation) section.

= Why should I use CoCart? =

The question is why not! WooCommerce's REST API is only created for controlling the backend of your store. It does not nativley provide an API for controlling the frontend.

CoCart handles your customers cart for you ready to use in any modern framework of your choosing. No local storing required. It's **Powerful** and **Developer** friendly ready to build your headless store the way you want, **without the need to build an API**.

If you are wanting to build a headless store powered by WooCommerce, then CoCart is your solution. But don't take my word for it. [Checkout the testimonials left by others](https://cocart.xyz/wall-of-love/?utm_medium=wp.org&utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=cocart).

With [the documentation](https://docs.cocart.xyz/?utm_medium=wp.org&utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=cocart) provided, you’ll see how to add products to a cart and allow your customers to manage it in no time at all.

= Who should use CoCart? =

CoCart is perfect for store owners and developers. If you want to create an e-commerce app for mobile or a custom frontend shopping experience completely using the REST API, then CoCart is for you.

= Do I need to have coding skills to use CoCart? =

As this plugin is built for developers, you will need to have some coding knowledge to use it. [Checkout the documentation](https://docs.cocart.xyz/?utm_medium=wp.org&utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=cocart) to get some understanding.

= Where can I find documentation for CoCart? =

You can find the documentation for CoCart on the [CoCart REST API Docs](https://docs.cocart.xyz/?utm_medium=wp.org&utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=cocart).

= Can I change the layout format/add/change details to the responses? =

You certainly can. Filters are available to do just that. [Checkout the tweaks plugin](https://github.com/co-cart/co-cart-tweaks) to view or maybe use the examples provided. [View the documentation](https://docs.cocart.xyz/?utm_medium=wp.org&utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=cocart) for more.

= Why does CoCart use a custom session handler in the first place? =

If you're familiar with WooCommerce, you may be wondering why using a custom session handler at all instead of the WooCommerce default session handler? A number of reasons but the ones that really matter are.

- The default session handler only supports cookies.
- The default session handler only saves changes at the end of the request in the `shutdown` hook.
- The default session handler has no support for concurrent requests.
- The default session handler does not support guest customers.
- The default session handler does not store additional data that maybe required to help you.
- More consistent with modern web.

= Why does CoCart use a custom session table in the database? =

The default WooCommerce session table only stores the basics of a cart in session. CoCart provides additional data that maybe required to help you and other add-ons/extensions developed by CoCart or third-parties.

Such as when the cart was created. This information is only stored in the browser session.

Also the source of the cart it was last saved. For the web it will be `WooCommerce` and for your headlesss store `CoCart`. This lets you know which version of your store your customers are shopping from should you have both web and app versions.

= Can I have WordPress running on one domain and my headless store on another domain? =

Yes of course. You just need to enable CORS. You can do that easily with [the CORS add-on](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cocart-cors/) or you can [manually enable it via the filters in the documentation](https://docs.cocart.xyz/#filters-api-access-cors-allow-all-cross-origin-headers).

=  Is "WooCommerce Shipping and Tax" plugin supported? =

Not at this time. "WooCommerce Shipping and Tax" ignore any REST API from allowing the ability to calculate the taxes from TaxJar. Code has been contributed to the plugin that will allow third-party plugins enable this ability and awaiting feedback.

However, TaxJar for WooCommerce plugin is supported.

= Is "TaxJar for WooCommerce" plugin supported? =

If you have "TaxJar for WooCommerce" v3.2.5 or above and CoCart v3.0 or above installed... then yes, it is supported.

= Why CoCart and not WooCommerce Store API? =

WooCommerce Store API is limited and designed mainly to focus on their [Gutenberg blocks](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woo-gutenberg-products-block/) they have developed in React. CoCart is designed to focus on decoupling WooCommerce so you can use any framework to allow your store to be headless.

Also, after tweaking WooCommerce Store API to work for decoupled purposes (which CoCart does not require), your still using the default session handler which does not support guest customers. CoCart uses it's own session handler which does support guest customers.

= Do you have a JavaScript Library? =

Yes we do. You can [find it here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cocart/cocart-rest-api). It doesn't require authentication for guest customers. It supports CommonJS (CJS) and ECMAScript Modules (ESM). Requests are made with [Axios library](https://github.com/axios/axios) with [support to promises](https://github.com/axios/axios#promises).

= Can I install/update CoCart via Composer? =

Yes. The best method would be to install/update CoCart from the GitHub repository but you can also do so via [https://wpackagist.org/](https://wpackagist.org/search?q=cart-rest-api-for-woocommerce&type=plugin)

= Does CoCart work for multi-site network? =

Yes. Just install CoCart and activate it via the network and all sites will have CoCart enabled.

= Can I enable white labelling for CoCart? =

Yes you can. You will have to edit your `wp-config.php` file to add a new constant. [Details can be found in the documentation](https://cocart.dev/articles/wp-config-php/?utm_medium=wp.org&utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=cocart#white-labelling).

= Does CoCart work with the Dokan plugin? =

Yes. The only feature you wont be able to use are coupons if you have [CoCart Pro](https://cocart.xyz/pro/?utm_medium=wp.org&utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=cocart). This is because Dokan disables the use of coupons in WooCommerce. All other features are compatible.

= Where can I report bugs? =

Report bugs on the [CoCart GitHub repository](https://github.com/co-cart/co-cart/issues). You can also notify us via the support forum – be sure to search the forums to confirm that the error has not already been reported.

= CoCart is awesome! Can I contribute? =

Yes, you can! Join in on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/co-cart/co-cart/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) and follow the [development blog](https://cocart.dev/news/?utm_medium=wp.org&utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=cocart) to stay up-to-date with everything happening in the project.

= Is CoCart translatable? =

Yes! CoCart is deployed with full translation and localization support via the ‘cart-rest-api-for-woocommerce’ text-domain.

= Where can I get help or talk other users about CoCart core? =

= v3.0.17 - 3rd December, 2021 =

### Bug Fixes

* Unable to remove items due to validation issue for certain edge cases. Reported by [Rozaliya Stoilova](https://github.com/rozalia) [Issue 287](https://github.com/co-cart/co-cart/issues/287)
* Uncaught Error: Call to undefined function `get_current_screen()`. Reported by [Tommie Lagerroos](https://github.com/lagerroos) for [Frontity](https://frontity.org/) compatibility.
* Loading of RTL stylesheet if `SCRIPT_DEBUG` is not enabled.

### Improvements

* Getting a single item with `cart/item` route now includes the `cart` route parameters so you can use all available.
* Validation of item key used to remove, update or restore an item.
* Weight does not forcefully round up the value. Shows the correct weight based on the quantity of item in cart. The weight is normalised unifying to "kg" then converted to the wanted unit set by the store settings. Reported by Miguel Peixe Aldeias.

### Tweaks

* Moved `backorders` and `cart_item_data` into the `get_item()` function instead so it returns data when `return_item` is set to true. Data was missing as it was outside this function. Reduced duplicate code in the process. 👍 Issue reported by [Christian Grosskop](https://github.com/fatheaddrummer) [Issue 288](https://github.com/co-cart/co-cart/issues/288)
* The `cart/item` route now extends the `cart` route for better code management.
* Filter `cocart_cart_item_key_required_message` now passes the correct status for the second parameter.

### Compatibility

* Tested: ✔️ Compatible with WooCommerce v5.9

### For Developers

* Introduced new filter `cocart_quantity_minimum_requirement` to specify minimum quantity requirement if not `1`.
